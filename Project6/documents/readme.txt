 *  Plucking a Guitar String

Hours to complete assignment (optional): 4 hours


/**********************************************************************
 *  Explain why it makes sense to have a separate RingBuffer class.
 **********************************************************************/
It makes sense to have a separate class for RingBuffer as there are many functions
that are in the class and many different processes going on at once that
should be checked separately so that it is easier to debug and run.
It gets very cluttered very fast if you throw everything into one
class, plus it makes it harder to test if things are working when you start
working on, say, guitar string, or guitar hero. Calling classes is much
easier than keeping track of a bunch of functions/variables.

I loved doing this project in general, as I am really into music and how
making music with computers works. I played a song for Louis, which I finally
ended up doing correctly after a few tries of getting used to the keyboard.
It's really cool seeing what goes into making a program like this.



/**********************************************************************

 **********************************************************************/
Biggest problems I ran into was during testing and working out all the 
bugs in my code. Aside from that I was struggling with how to make
each key on the keyboard bind to the "keyboard" string at a given index,
but Austin helped me work through this.

Received help on the last Class, GuitarHero, from Austin the tutor.
